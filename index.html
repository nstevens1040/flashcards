They allow you to identify and address issues in the system before customers notice them. You can set alerts on metrics, logs, and the activity log. Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks. Metrics is a feature of Azure Monitor that collects numeric data from monitored resources into a time-series database. Metrics are numerical values that are collected at regular intervals and describe some aspect of a system at a particular time.</p>\n<p>When Azure Monitor data indicates that there may be an issue with an infrastructure or application, an alert is triggered. Azure Monitor, Azure Service Health, and Azure Advisor then use action groups to notify users about the alert and take action. An action group is a collection of notification preferences defined by the owner of an Azure subscription.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/monitor-virtual-network\">Monitoring Azure virtual networks | Microsoft Learn</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/configure-azure-monitor/4-define-metrics-logs\">Define metrics and logs - Training | Microsoft Learn</a></p>\n","type":"MultiSelect","choiceCount":4,"id":870,"locale":"en-us","createdAtUTC":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"userChoice":[{"questionnaireId":54,"questionId":870,"text":"an alert rule ","textHtml":"","isCorrect":true,"id":3446,"locale":"en-us","createdAtUTC":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},{"questionnaireId":54,"questionId":870,"text":"an action group ","textHtml":"","isCorrect":true,"id":3447,"locale":"en-us","createdAtUTC":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"}],"correctChoice":[{"questionnaireId":54,"questionId":870,"text":"an alert rule ","textHtml":"","isCorrect":true,"id":3446,"locale":"en-us","createdAtUTC":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},{"questionnaireId":54,"questionId":870,"text":"an action group ","textHtml":"","isCorrect":true,"id":3447,"locale":"en-us","createdAtUTC":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"}]},{"question":{"questionnaireId":54,"choices":[{"questionnaireId":54,"questionId":871,"text":"a Log Analytics workspace ","textHtml":"","isCorrect":true,"id":3450,"locale":"en-us","createdAtUTC":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},{"questionnaireId":54,"questionId":871,"text":"an Azure Machine Learning workspace","textHtml":"","isCorrect":false,"id":3451,"locale":"en-us","createdAtUTC":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},{"questionnaireId":54,"questionId":871,"text":"metrics logs ","textHtml":"","isCorrect":false,"id":3452,"locale":"en-us","createdAtUTC":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},{"questionnaireId":54,"questionId":871,"text":"resource logs ","textHtml":"","isCorrect":false,"id":3453,"locale":"en-us","createdAtUTC":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"}],"name":"","text":"You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:\n\n- Eight virtual networks\n- 24 virtual machines\n- 16 storage accounts\n   \nYou need to implement a monitoring solution that provides the ability to view diagnostics and telemetry data generated by Azure resources.\n\nWhat should you include in the solution?\n\n","textHtml":"<p>You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eight virtual networks</li>\n<li>24 virtual machines</li>\n<li>16 storage accounts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You need to implement a monitoring solution that provides the ability to view diagnostics and telemetry data generated by Azure resources.</p>\n<p>What should you include in the solution?</p>\n","rationale":"A Log Analytics workspace is a unique environment for log data from Azure Monitor and other Azure services, such as Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
